## What is an EMI Loan?

An Equated Monthly Installment (EMI) is a fixed payment amount made by a borrower to a lender at a specified date each calendar month. EMIs are used to pay off both interest and principal every month so that over a specified number of years, the loan is fully paid off. EMI loans are commonly used for home loans, car loans, and personal loans.
